# Capstone-Project-2
Exploratory Data Analysis
This is project 2 in the Data Analytics level (level 2) of the Data Science Bootcamp with HyperionDev.
For this task, I cleaned, sanitised and explored data using the movies dataset(https://github.com/JanHof/Capstone-Project-2/blob/main/automobile.txt),
and answered questions in the Capstone Project II.ipynb notebook.https://github.com/JanHof/Capstone-Project-2/blob/main/Capstone%20Project%20II-checkpoint.ipynb
I then used the automibile.txt( to clean and explore data and come up with data visualisations. and wrote a report on investigations, visualisations and findings.
