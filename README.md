# Capstone-Project-2
Exploratory Data Analysis
This is project 2 in the Data Analytics level (level 2) of the Data Science Bootcamp with HyperionDev.
For this task, I cleaned, sanitised and explored data using the 'movies' dataset(https://github.com/JanHof/Capstone-Project-2/blob/main/automobile.txt).
The 'movies' dataset is a csv file that contains a table of movie titles with categorical and numeric information about the movies. Revenue, Budget and popularity of the movie is included in the dataset. I answered questions about the 'movies' dataset in the Capstone Project II.ipynb notebook.https://github.com/JanHof/Capstone-Project-2/blob/main/Capstone%20Project%20II-checkpoint.ipynb
I then used the automibile.txt(https://github.com/JanHof/Capstone-Project-2/blob/main/automobile.txt). A txt table that contains data of different makes of vehicles. The dimensions of the vehicle's body and engine are included in  the dataset. Some output variables include mile per gallon and rpm. The vehicle price is also included.
I clean and did exploratory data analysis on the data. I created h data visualisations in . and wrote a report on investigations, visualisations and findings(https://github.com/JanHof/Capstone-Project-2/blob/main/EDA1.docx).
